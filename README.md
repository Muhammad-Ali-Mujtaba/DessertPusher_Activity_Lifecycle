# DessertPusher - Activity Lifecycle

This is a cookie clicker type of Android app in which you press a button for money and better desserts; it focuses on the lifecycle of activities and fragments. 

It implements different lifecycle callback methods and uses the lifecycle library for the LifecycleObserver class and more. 

It also preserves the data of the activity through configuration changes such as orientation change or even if the OS destroys the activity.
