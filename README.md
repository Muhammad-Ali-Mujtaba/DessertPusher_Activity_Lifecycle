# DessertPusher - Activity Lifecycle

This is a cookie clicker type of Android app in which you press a button for money and better desserts; through which I learned about the lifecycle of activities and fragments. 

I implemented different lifecycle callback methods and used the lifecycle library for the LifecycleObserver class and more. 

I also learned to preserve the data of the activity through configuration changes such as orientation change or even if the OS destroys the activity.
